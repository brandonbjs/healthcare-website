## Summary of Project

### Project Idea:

The objective of this project is to create an interactive website application for a family who has a child with a disability. The idea is to provide resources and information to other families that might have similar situations at home.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to practice, improve, and showcase my MERN stack development capabilities. The healthcare website will provide information, counseling, and resources for families with children with disabilities.

### Planning:

-   **Front-End Development:** The front-end user interface will be designed using React and styled using CSS. I will uphold ES6 best practices to provide the user with an intuitive and enjoyable character building experience.
-   **Back-End Development:** The back-end will consist of a MongoDB that will be integrated using Node.js and Express.js. I will be creating a custom Node.js API, fit with suitable endpoints that will make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to and from my MongoDB.
-   **Hosting:** The webpage is hosted using GitHub Pages and the API+MongoDB are served on an Amazon EC2 instance.

### Functionality

The healthcare website will provide information, counseling, and resources for families with children with disabilities.
